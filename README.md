# fugashi

<img src="https://github.com/polm/fugashi/raw/master/fugashi.png" width=125 height=125 alt="fugashi by Irasutoya" />

fugashi is a Cython wrapper for [MeCab](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/), a
Japanese tokenizer and morphological analysis tool.  Wheels are provided for
Linux, OSX (Intel), and Win64, and UniDic is [easy to install](#installing-a-dictionary).

Check out the [interactive demo][], see the [blog post](https://www.dampfkraft.com/nlp/fugashi.html) for background
on why fugashi exists and some of the design decisions, or see [this
guide][guide] for a basic introduction to Japanese tokenization.

[interactive demo]: https://share.streamlit.io/polm/fugashi-streamlit-demo/main/demo.py

If you are on a platform for which wheels are not provided, you'll need to
install MeCab first. It's recommended you install [from
source](https://github.com/taku910/mecab). If you need to build from source on
Windows, [@chezou's fork](https://github.com/chezou/mecab) is recommended; see
[issue #44](https://github.com/polm/fugashi/issues/44#issuecomment-954426115)
for an explanation of the problems with the official repo.

Known platforms without wheels:

- musl-based distros like alpine [#77](https://github.com/polm/fugashi/issues/77)
- PowerPC
- Windows 32bit

## Usage

```python
from fugashi import Tagger

tagger = Tagger('-Owakati')
text = "麩菓子は、麩を主材料とした日本の菓子。"
tagger.parse(text)
# => '麩 菓子 は 、 麩 を 主材 料 と し た 日本 の 菓子 。'
for word in tagger(text):
    print(word, word.feature.lemma, word.pos, sep='\t')
    # "feature" is the Unidic feature data as a named tuple
```

## Installing a Dictionary

fugashi requires a dictionary. [UniDic](https://unidic.ninjal.ac.jp/) is
recommended, and two easy-to-install versions are provided.

  - [unidic-lite](https://github.com/polm/unidic-lite), a slightly modified version 2.1.2 of Unidic (from 2013) that's relatively small
  - [unidic](https://github.com/polm/unidic-py), the latest UniDic 3.1.0, which is 770MB on disk and requires a separate download step

If you just want to make sure things work you can start with `unidic-lite`, but
for more serious processing `unidic` is recommended. For production use you'll
generally want to generate your own dictionary too; for details see the [MeCab
documentation](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/learn.html).

To get either of these dictionaries, you can install them directly using `pip`
or do the below:

```sh
pip install 'fugashi[unidic-lite]'

# The full version of UniDic requires a separate download step
pip install 'fugashi[unidic]'
python -m unidic download
```

For more information on the different MeCab dictionaries available, see [this article](https://www.dampfkraft.com/nlp/japanese-tokenizer-dictionaries.html).

## Dictionary Use

fugashi is written with the assumption you'll use Unidic to process Japanese,
but it supports arbitrary dictionaries. 

If you're using a dictionary besides Unidic you can use the GenericTagger like this:

```python
from fugashi import GenericTagger
tagger = GenericTagger()

# parse can be used as normal
tagger.parse('something')
# features from the dictionary can be accessed by field numbers
for word in tagger(text):
    print(word.surface, word.feature[0])
```

You can also create a dictionary wrapper to get feature information as a named tuple. 

```python
from fugashi import GenericTagger, create_feature_wrapper
CustomFeatures = create_feature_wrapper('CustomFeatures', 'alpha beta gamma')
tagger = GenericTagger(wrapper=CustomFeatures)
for word in tagger.parseToNodeList(text):
    print(word.surface, word.feature.alpha)
```

However, even in such projects, languages with special processing requirements are often excluded. One such language is Japanese. Japanese is written without spaces, tokenization is non-trivial, and while high quality open source tokenizers exist they can be hard to use and lack English documentation. This paper introduces fugashi, a MeCab wrapper for Python, and gives an introduction to tokenizing Japanese.",

## Alternatives

If you have a problem with fugashi feel free to open an issue. However, there
are some cases where it might be better to use a different library.

- If you don't want to deal with installing MeCab at all, try [SudachiPy](https://github.com/WorksApplications/sudachi.rs).
- If you need to work with Korean, try [pymecab-ko](https://github.com/NoUnique/pymecab-ko) or [KoNLPy](https://konlpy.org/en/latest/).
